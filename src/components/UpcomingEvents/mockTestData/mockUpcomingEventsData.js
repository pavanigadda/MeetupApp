DevMountain will have someone stationed outside the front door to direct people into the building.<br/>---<br/>Mike will take the group through setting up a new React app and some of the basics around ReactJS. This will take us through many of the buzzwords like: component, virtual DOM, props, state. This will be interactive, so questions are encouraged.</p> <p>Mike Mathew is a career-switcher who used to teach drum line and now helps the world have better internet websites. His day job is working as a front end developer at Call-Em-All in Frisco. By night Mike is playing with his children, learning more about front end lore, or building the Presto Assistant app to help fine arts teachers. He helps organize the ReactJS Dallas meetup where he enjoys connecting the Dallas community together over Code, Pizza, and Pedantic Buzz Words.</p> ",
